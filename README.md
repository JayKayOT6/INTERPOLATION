<h1>INTERPOLATION</h1>			

<p>
<h3> 18th September 2017</h3>
INTERPOLATION is an original story and coded layout created by JayKayOT6. You can view the webpage at https://jaykayot6.github.io/INTERPOLATION/
				
A static HTML page with more than one interactive scrolling panes, images, various internal links and aesthetivally appealing colour palette. INTERPOLATION is sure to catch the eyes of curious people, whether it be by the simple blurb or the unique story presentation<br>
				
The story was initially uploaded on a platform that does not support CSS, JS or Bootstrap. This layout was every hard to work with and uploading each chapter was an arduous task consisiting of editing text files to fit HTML requirements, this method was time taking and ineffeicient, btu it worked for the previous platform.<br>
			
My current endevaours are to try my hands at Javascript and globalise my layout. Rather than hardcoding in each chapter in I'd like to try seeing if I can read in a file with the chapters included. I've got some plans in my head, I hope I can execute them sucessfully.
